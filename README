# BabelShip ðŸ—¼ðŸš¢

Free passage (of content) across the web.

This toolset includes:

1. A library to translate across different format of online conversation (e.g. Markdown<=>Tumblogs, Twitter threads<=>HTML blogposts), with sensible defaults.
2. A set of highly stylable UI components to natively display user-generated content from across the web.
3. A set of [Iframely](https://iframely.com/) plugins to easily fetch content from various social websites in a compatible format.

While these tools are meant to work well together, each of them can be used independently.

If you wish to embed external content from other websites as part of the text editing experience of your own software, check out [the set of experimental TipTap plugins](https://github.com/essential-randomness/boba-editor-next) based on BabelShip.
